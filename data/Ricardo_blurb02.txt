For over a hundred years we have been teaching and learning physics through textbooks. This is the result of a well-established tradition and has many advantages. However, it also makes physics teaching more distant from the original ideas of the discipline and tends to obscure their historical genesis. What if we went back to the origins and read the primary sources? Could physics students make sense of them, and, more importantly, would they gain something from being confronted with ideas-in-the-making? This idea may sound appealing until one opens a random original source (e.g., Newtonâ€™s Principia) and is overwhelmed by its complexity. Unfamiliar concepts, notation, mathematical formalism, etc. often make primary sources simply unintelligible at a first glance. The challenge is, then, a matter of didactical design. This research investigates the pedagogical potential of primary sources by carefully selecting excerpts of original sources and identifying deep insights they provide compared with traditional teaching.
