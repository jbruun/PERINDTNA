Educational investigations of in situ classroom interventions are often complicated and littered with pitfalls. Classroom observation and audio transcriptions are very time consuming and come with an inevitable bias of the observer, self reporting from or interviews of students and teachers affects the subjects of the investigation. Furthermore, automated data collection and treatment systems are often reductive and have difficulties describing a complex social situation like a classroom. Despite this, we still need to investigate how teaching works if we donâ€™t want teaching methodology to be developed on the basis of dogmas stemming from tradition or anecdotal evidence. In this area we are trying to formulate what observations are needed to quantify whether inquiry based teaching is happening in a classroom setting. So far this work has focused on combinations of binary observation of classroom interactions in a time sequence. The binary nature of the observation helps to minimize observational bias. The time sequence of observations can be represented as a directed, and cluster analysis can be applied to find and classify structures in the classroom interactions. We aim to expand our methods to also include automatic trincribation of audio recordings that can then be represented by word networks to give an overview of the verbal content of the teaching.
