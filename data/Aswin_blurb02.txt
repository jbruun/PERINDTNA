In higher education, physics courses introduce students to many fundamental principles used to explain the theories underlying the other natural sciences. Students majoring in the natural sciences unwittingly use many essential concepts of physics. However, mandatory physics courses, such as physics introductory, usually explain physics concepts without linking them to interdisciplinary scientific knowledge. This gives rise to the perception that the physical sciences are not meaningful or applicable.  As a result, students lose interest in studying this subject. This research will uncover how to teach physics effectively to interdisciplinary learners. Teaching strategies will also be created to support active learning processes in the classroom.
