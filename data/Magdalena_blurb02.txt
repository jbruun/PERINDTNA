Technology shapes the lives of learners and has become a means to experience and understand the world. From computer simulations and extended reality learning environments to shared virtual spaces and teaching platforms, technologies open exciting opportunities to enrich how we teach and learn physics. In the PER group, we study the educational potential of emerging technologies and develop practical and innovative learning designs that make physics concepts experienceable, relevant and meaningful for learners.
