Formative assessment is one of the key strategies for physics teachers to help students develop their competencies in physics. We define competency in physics as the ability and will to to act, alone and with others, using curiosity, knowledge, skills, strategies, and meta-knowledge as these apply to physics, to negotiate meaning, to develop a distinct identity within the field of physics, and to participate in relevant decision-making situations. In formative assessment, teachers and students work together to identify studentsâ€™ current levels of competencies and to design goals and tasks that will help students develop their competencies in physics even further. We work in different modalities, including, written, oral, kinaesthetic, computer-based, teacher-student, and peer assessment. Formative assessment in our view is tied to motivation, particularly, self-determination theory.
