From the bigbang to black holes, from climate change to the science that underpins modern technology, our knowledge of the world builds on Einsteinian physics. Einsteinian physics is based on two major theories of physics: special and general relativity, which describe space, time, and gravity at the cosmic scale, and quantum physics which describes the interactions of matter and radiation at scales down to the smallest subatomic particles. In the PER group, we develop learning resources and study learning processes in Einsteinian physics across K12. Our activities are part of the international Einsteinian Physics Education Research (EPER) Collaboration, and we work with the Einstein-First project in Australia to develop a seamless Einsteinian physics curriculum. Together with the PER group of CERN, we also organise the International Modern Physics & Research in Education Seminar Series (IMPRESS) to give momentum to Einsteinian physics education and increase the visibility of physics education research.
