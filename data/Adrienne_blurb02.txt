Decades of research have strongly argued for the effectiveness of active learning compared to passive information-transfer instruction. However, “active learning” and similar terms cover a wide range of classroom activities. The vocabulary to discuss the differences between pedagogies is still developing. This project uses network and classroom observation data to characterize similarities and differences between several research-based university physics curricula. In developing more systematic ways to describe these learning environments, we hope to empower instructors to choose teaching methods suited to their learning goals and local contexts.
