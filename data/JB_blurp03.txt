The fields of physics and computer science continuously develop sophisticated tools for collecting and analyzing data quantitatively. DSEâ€™s PER group aims at combining these tools with strong qualitative traditions in educational research to produce profoundly new knowledge about educational systems. A key direction is to investigate network analysis as a methodological tool for uncovering subtle but important patterns in data; for instance, student group formation patterns, navigation patterns in web-based teaching materials, or text-analysis with linguistic networks. Our current research also investigates how to enhance analyses of classroom video, classroom audio, and student generated products from teaching using, for example, machine learning techniques. An important part of our strategies for analyses is to intertwine qualitative and quantitative analyses; qualitative analyses provide us with the means to interpret quantitative patterns and vice versa.
