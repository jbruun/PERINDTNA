There is growing agreement among physics educators that learners understand, experience, and study the world through and with their bodies. For example, gestures and kinaesthetic activities can promote the learning of classical mechanics because gestures provide sensorimotor information that prompts idea construction. Besides, learners often project patterns of sensorimotor experiences onto more abstract domains to make sense of physics concepts that are far removed from our sensory capabilities. In the PER group, we venture outside of narrowly understood views of cognition to advance and enrich our understanding of embodied physics education. A greater appreciation of the embodied mechanisms of physics learning can improve instructional practices and make physics more accessible to a broader range of students.
