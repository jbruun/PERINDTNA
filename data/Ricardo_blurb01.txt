Physics and mathematics are deeply interwoven and there are many educational consequences of this fruitful, yet complex, relationship. Our research involves considering the following three complementary dimensions: Historical and Epistemological Studies. Physics and Mathematics have been deeply interrelated since the very beginning of scientific knowledge and this mutual influence has played an essential role on both their developments. Historical case studies show us not only physics problems motivating the creation of mathematical concepts but also pure mathematics being used to derive conclusions about the real world. Learning/Cognitive Perspective. The main difficulties students face when using mathematics to solve physics problems and or transferring their knowledge from a mathematical to a physical context need to be investigated. Moreover, it is important to understand how the ability of using mathematics as a reasoning instrument in physics – instead of using it as a mere calculation tool – is developed. Teaching/Didactic Perspective. Teaching activities and materials have to be carefully designed in order to encourage students to structure their thought mathematically in physical contexts. Due to the crucial responsability of the teacher for the success of this challenge, such didactical aspects have to be sistematically approached in teacher education. Aditionally, criteria for evaluating the quality of instruction, regarding the focus on several aspects of the relationship of physics and mathematics, should be established.
