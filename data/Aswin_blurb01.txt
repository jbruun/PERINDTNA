Physicists commonly use equations to guide their reasoning thus an essential part of physics education is to teach students to do so. However, in the teaching-learning process, the focus is typically on calculating and identifying the symbols rather than on gaining a conceptual understanding of the principles underlying the equations. Students can obtain a genuine knowledge of physics equations if they can develop a conceptual understanding of the principles involved. Physics equations embody a substantial amount of conceptual knowledge of physics and mathematics. Through analyzing physics equations deeply, one can learn many hidden important physics concepts. My research will reveal students’ main conceptual difficulties in understanding the physical meaning of the physics equations that are mostly represented in mathematical symbols. This research will attempt to uncover the reasons why those difficulties arise. This study will also consider various teaching strategies that may assist students more effectively to develop a conceptual understanding of the physics equations. Physics education should not be measured merely by a student’s knowledge of mathematical symbols. A student should also have a thorough, conceptual understanding of the principles those symbols represent.
