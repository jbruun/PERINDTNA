Narrative based teaching is a branch of scenario didactics, where the students gain competencies in a subject by engaging in an authentic scenario where they have to solve problems in the same manner as professionals. In narrative based teaching we expand on this principle by creating a narrative around the scenario where the students are also asked to put on the persona of the expert, thus removing them from the setting of the classroom. Our research indicates that there are several advantages to this approach, for instance it can help students forget the pressure of grades or social heracies in the classroom, thus giving them an alibi for participating. This allows the students to engage in a scientific discussion without having to think about the consequences of saying the wrong thing. Other advantages could be an enhanced motivation for the students since the narrative can give a more authentic frame for the assignment, or the narrative can enhance student memory of the subject, by tying it to events inthe narrative. To investigate the effect of a narrative approach to teaching we have created a teaching material called Marsbasen. This covers all the mandatory physics in upper secondary education, and is though through a story of the colonization and exploration of Mars, where the students take the role of colonists. As part of our research of narrative based education we have developed a tool to ensure thematic coherence in narrative teaching. This will help educators who want to try a narrative approach create lessons where the assignments are set in the diegesis of the narrative. This will help students stay in the narrative and strengthen the alibi for participation.
