Science careers are not just a matter of technical skill and hard work, but are embedded in networks of social connections that confer affective and instrumental support. Workplace studies have highlighted constraints and barriers to these networks for women and LGBT+ persons in physics. Members of these groups are at greater risk of discrimination or harassment, and may have less access to useful connections or resources. However, key network analysis findings are decades old (for women) or have not been established (for LGBT+ scientists). This project is using qualitative interviews and ego network analysis to map the professional support networks of PhD physicists. We wish to expand on recent climate survey findings and highlight workforce sectors or job situations where professional societies might offer interventions or support.
