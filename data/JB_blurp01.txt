Our work includes developing and testing both teaching formats and teaching technologies in physics education. We see a teaching format as a structured way of planning and performing teaching. We work extensively with formats that emphasize student agency and autonomy in the learning process, for instance inquiry-based models and scenario-based models. We see teaching technologies as practical applications of educational research, which affords knowledge, skills, and strategies for both teacher and student. Technologies include a diverse set of applications, such as the use of pen and paper, of different types of teaching/learning activities, and of computer software. Technology is for us embedded in teaching and serves an identifiable purpose.
